A 3D Snake game which I made during my time in Futuregames, initially for our course on algorithms and data structures, and later on for an assignement on Design Patterns.

The game essentially works as a simple survival chamber, where your objective is to collect as many apples as you can to increase your score, while avoiding collision with the asteroids which move through it.

Red and green apples are worth very few points, while golden apples are worth the most points. There are also apples which work as powerups: the wind apple temporarily sucks in apples in front of the player, the ghost apple allows the player to move through the rocks, and the time apple slows down the movement of the asteroids.

Here is some short gameplay footage:
